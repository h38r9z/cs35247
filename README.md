Preamble The   spate   of market   gyrations   in   recent   times   have   had   a   significant   impact   on   options   pricing   dynamics, leading to higher implied volatility and   steepened   volatility   skew   across   a   spectrum   of   strike   prices.   Yet,   much   of the   volatility   in   the   equities   market   has   been   attributed   to   increased   interest in trading out of   the money   options.The   volatility   skew   of   a   stock   option   can   offer   insight   into   traders’   interest   in   the   stock,   thus   providing   valuable   cues   into often   volatile   price   movements. Opportunities   can   be   had   with   the   myriads   of   option   strategies   available   to   take   advantage   of   the   potential   price   movements. In   this   assignment,   you   would   analyse   the   put-call   ratio   and   volatility   skew   of a   stock   option   to   determine the market sentiment    and      potential price swings. Armed with this information, determine an appropriate option strategy to capitalise   on   the   opportunity presented.
